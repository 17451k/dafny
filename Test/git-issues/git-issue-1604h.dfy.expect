git-issue-1604h.dfy(7,35): Error: Could not prove that the range constrains the bound variable 'j' to be of type GhostNat, and since GhostNat is a ghost subset type, no runtime type filter can be added on the collection whose elements have the type int.
git-issue-1604h.dfy(5,31): [Related location] GhostNat is ghost because ghost fields are allowed only in specification contexts
git-issue-1604h.dfy(10,17): Error: possible division by zero
